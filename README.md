# MSE FTP Fourier (Spring Semester 2017)
## From Fourier to Wavelets

Some exercises/problems are treated with python (version 2.7) or octave, thanks to the open source community. The exercises/problems are not solved at all, but with some small modifications it is easy to get what is questioned. 

The `ps##_....` files coresponds to the `ftp_fourier_theoryps##.pdf` problem sheets in the theory part (part I, week 2-8). The `ex##_...` files coresponds to the exercise sheets `ftp_fourier_app_ex##.pdf` in the application part (part II, week 1, 9-14).

### Python

In python the packages PyWavelets and matplotlib (to visualize the data) are used. PyWavelets is briefly but well [documented](http://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "PyWavelets Documentation"), might more specific the [API Reference](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/index.html "PyWavelets API Reference").

You might need to install some python packages:

    pip2 install PyWavelets matplotlib opencv-python

### Octave/Matlab

Im working with octave, the scripts will run with some small modifications in matlab. You might need to delet or comment one of the first lines 'pkg load ...'. in octave the "toolboxes"/packages must be loaded explicitly.

# MSE FTP Fourier (Spring Semester 2017)
## From Fourier to Wavelets

Some exercises/problems are treated with python (version 2.7) using the packages PyWavelets and matplotlib (to visualize the data), thanks to the open source community. The exercises are not solved at all, but with some small modifications it is easy to get what is questioned.

PyWavelets is briefly but well [documented](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/index.html "PyWavelets Documentation"), might more specific the [API Reference](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/index.html "PyWavelets API Reference").

NOTE:
You might need to install some python packages: 
    pip2 install PyWavelets matplotlib opencv-python
